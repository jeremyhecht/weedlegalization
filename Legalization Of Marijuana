 <h2 id="legalizationandregulation">Marijuana Legalization and Regulation</h2>
<div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">There is more public support for marijuana law reform than ever before with new polls showing more than half the country is in favor of legalizing marijuana. The Drug Policy Alliance (DPA) believes marijuana should be removed from the criminal justice system and regulated like alcohol and tobacco.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Us Policy on Drugs was driven by the Drug War, the U.S. prison population is six to ten times as high as most Western European nations. The United States is a close second only to Russia in its rate of incarceration per 100,000 people. In 2010, more than 746,000 people were arrested in the USA for marijuana-related offenses alone. People are realizing across the world that marijuana legalization is vital for medicine. Plus it may even be beneficial to legalize weed as a recreational drug similar to alcohol.</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Nine states &mdash; Alaska, California, Colorado, Maine, Massachusetts, Nevada, Oregon, Vermont and Washington &mdash; plus the District of Columbia allow recreational sales of marijuana. Another 21 states allow only some form of medical marijuana and 16 allow a lesser medical marijuana extract.</span></p>

 <h2 id="2018initiatives">2018 Initiatives</h2>
<div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">At least 12 states are poised to consider marijuana legalization this year, with more possibly joining as legislative sessions continue, making 2018 a potentially pivotal year in the burgeoning bud movement. Some states are even preparing to take unprecedented legislative steps to make marijuana legal and more easily accessible</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Vermont Governor Phil Scott privately signed the recreational marijuana law on January 22 with "mixed emotions."
</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">New Jersey Governor-elect Phil Murphy has pledged to sign adult use regulation legislation within his first 100 days in office.
</span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the Michigan ballot in 2018, Marijuana advocates submitted 360,000 signatures in November 2017 in favor of the proposal.</span></p>

 <h2 id="ProLegalize">Why We Should Legalize</h2>
<div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To reduce harm. The criminalization of marijuana use disproportionately harms young people and people of color, sponsors massive levels of violence and corruption, and fails to curb youth access<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To create jobs. Legalizing and regulating marijuana will bring one of the nation's largest cash crops under the rule of law. This will create jobs and economic opportunities in the formal economy instead of the illicit market.<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To save money. Scarce law enforcement resources will be better used to ensure public safety while reducing corrections and court costs. State and local governments would gain significant new sources of tax revenue from regulating marijuana sales.<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">To promote consumer safety. Marijuana product testing is becoming a standard requirement for legalized marijuana markets. This means consumers are better informed about the marijuana they use.<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
</div>

 <h2 id="NoLegalize">Why We Should Not Legalize</h2>
<div>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Damages Health. Smoking any substance will have a negative and potentially life-threatening effect on your respiratory health. Marijuana use can affect a person's memory, IQ, judgment, and problem-solving skills.<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Endagers Public Safety. Marijuana can cause impairment in the user. This means if a person is driving whilst under the influence, they may be more prone to having a collision and potentially harming others.<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">It is linked with dangerous narcotics. Due to drug laws in America marijuana has been listed as a narcotic along with heroin, cocaine, meth and other dangerous substances. Marijuana is often described to be a gateway drug, meaning users who take cannabis are more likely to take harder, more dangerous drugs.<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
<p style="font-weight: 400;">Lowers quality of life. Some smokers of marijuana find themselves unable to look for work due to lack of motivation and some fail to carry out normal tasks.<span style="font-weight: 400;"></span></p>
